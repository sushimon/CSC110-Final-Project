# CSC110 Final Project
----------------------
This is the final project I made for CSC110 at the University of Toronto. The theme of this assignment was to perform a computational exploration on the impact of COVID-19.

## GETTING STARTED
Download all the files in the repository and ensure that they are all in the same directory. Download all the required libraries in requirements.txt and run main.py to run the application.
